# real_audition
real_audition allows LUFS matched playback of audio files. It's hard to know which composition, mix, or master is better when one is louder than another.

# Features
- Loudness normalization!
- Plays most audio files
- sick gui filled with kaomojis °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°

# How it works - the three modes
- Normalize lufs of all files to be the same as the quietest file
- Any track greater than 14 lufs gets turned down to 14 lufs (mimmics playback on streaming services like Spotify)
- No loudness normalization

# Available on
Windows currently. It needs to be compiled for linux and OSX. If anyone with a linux or mac system would do that it would be awesome!

# General notes
I smashed this out in two days without any idea how to do GUI's and such. Improvements are welcome c:
