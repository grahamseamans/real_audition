# real_audition
real_audition allows LUFS matched playback of audio files. It's hard to know which composition, mix, or master is better when one is louder than another.

# Features
- Loudness normalization!
- Plays most audio files.
- Sick GUI filled with kaomojis °˖✧◝(⁰▿⁰)◜✧˖°.

# How it works - the three modes
- Normalize LUFS of all files to be the same as the quietest file.
- Any track greater than 14 LUFS gets turned down to 14 LUFS (mimics playback on streaming services like Spotify).
- No loudness normalization.

# Available on
Windows currently. It needs to be compiled for linux and OSX. If anyone with a linux or mac system would do that it would be awesome!

# General notes
I smashed this out in two days without any idea how to do GUI's and such. Improvements are welcome.
