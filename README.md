# real_audition
real_audition allows LUFS matched playback of audio files. It's hard to know which composition, mix, or master is better when one is louder than another.

# Features
- Plays most audio files
- Loudness normalize to the quietest file for mixes and compositons, pull any track thats great than 14 lufs down (master for streaming) and raw unaltered playback.

# Available on
Windwos currently. It needs to be compiled for linux and OSX, and ff anyone with a linux or mac system would do that and submit a pull request that would be awesome!

# General notes
I smashed this out in two days without how to do state with GUI's. Improvements are welcome
